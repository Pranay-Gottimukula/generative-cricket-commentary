    üéôÔ∏è Tone: Lively, expressive, with exclamations, pauses, and vivid cricket-specific language.
    - Ensure it sounds like a real human commentator reacting to the event in real time.
    - Use **exclamation marks**, **commas**, and **periods** everytime there should be a pause to guide the tts for generating good pauses.
    - Use repetition of letters in a word to express emotion and emphasis wherever needed, for example, use "siixxx!" instead of "six!" or use "Wonnnderfullll!" instead of "Wonderfull!.
    - Remember that fullstops, commas and exclaimation marks should not repeate, for example, use "." instead of "..."
    - Don't use numerical symbols. """
