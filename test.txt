Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems trained on vast amounts of text data.
They use deep learning techniques, particularly transformer architectures, to understand and generate human-like language.
LLMs can perform a variety of tasks such as answering questions, summarizing text, translating languages, and generating creative content. Popular examples include OpenAI's GPT series and Google's PaLM. Their capabilities continue to grow as models become larger and training data increases, making them valuable tools in many fields.
